## Introduction to CARE-SM

Clinical And Registry Entries (CARE-SM) is a semantic data model designed to effectively represent healthcare patient information by using knowledge graphs represented in the Resource Description Framework (RDF). This technical description aims to provide a comprehensive overview of CARE-SM, its origins, and the design principles that underlie its structure.

### Genesis of CARE-SM

CARE-SM is a more robust and matured representation of its precursor, the Common Data Element (CDE) semantic data model. The primary objective of its creation was to develop a semantic data model capable of representing [a set of common data elements for rare diseases registration](https://eu-rd-platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/CDS/EU_RD_Platform_CDS_Final.pdf) recommended by the European Commission Joint Research Centre. CARE-SM stands as the matured iteration of this CDE semantic model, extending its capabilities to encompass the representation of all data elements pertinent to patient registries and clinical encounters.


## Full Documentation
Explore our specification [here](https://care-sm.github.io/CARE-Semantic-Model/) for full documentation, examples, operational details and other information.

## Implementation

This repository primarily focuses on presenting the principles behind the data model and its behavior through a theoretical description.

For information on various workflows for implementing this data model, visit our [CARE-SM implementation repository](https://github.com/CARE-SM/CARE-SM-Implementation).


## Communication and feedback
Your feedback is more than welcome. It will help us improve our semantic data model. Please use [github issues](https://github.com/CARE-SM/CARE-Semantic-Model/issues) to provide your feedback.
